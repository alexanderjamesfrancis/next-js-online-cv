            <p class="my-4 px-16">I am a trusted and experienced people manager, with a strong customer service background. My own feedback says that I am driven but calm, reliable, honest and consistent. I am a completer-finisher who likes to develop teams who deliver on high
                quality customer service, and in my previous role I already provided training to others regularly. I am highly adaptable and have a perpetual goal to improve myself and learn. I am now looking for the next upward step in my career to expand my
                skill base and broaden my experience. </p>
            <p class="self-description my-4 px-16">My experiences up till now have led to be re-focus my career effort to code. This CV is the first of, hopefully, many more websites to come.</p>
